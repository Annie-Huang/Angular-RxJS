empty:
Observable that immediately completes.

combineLatest:
When any observable emits a value, emit the last emitted value from each.
It only start emitting when all stream stared of values. e.g. stream 1 emit at 1s, stream 2 emit at 4s, stream 3 emits at 9s.
Then the first value to emit is at 9s.

forkJoin
When all observables complete, emit the last emitted value from each.

withLatestFrom
Combines the source Observable with other Observables to create an Observable whose values are calculated from the latest values of each, only when the source emits.
Like combineLatest, it will only emit value when both 's' and 'c' has emitted value (Module06 Combining Streams - Note41 - Marble Diagram - withLatestFrom.jpg).
And from then on, every time 'a' emit a value, it will find the latest of 's' and 'c' value.


combineLatest is more popular
Because combineLatest can use with http and action, or http and http
Where as forkJoin usually only use in http and http.
