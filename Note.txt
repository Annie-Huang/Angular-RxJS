RxJS: Reactive Extensions for JavaScript

empty:
Observable that immediately completes.

combineLatest:
When any observable emits a value, emit the last emitted value from each.
It only start emitting when all stream stared of values. e.g. stream 1 emit at 1s, stream 2 emit at 4s, stream 3 emits at 9s.
Then the first value to emit is at 9s.

forkJoin
When all observables complete, emit the last emitted value from each.

withLatestFrom
Combines the source Observable with other Observables to create an Observable whose values are calculated from the latest values of each, only when the source emits.
Like combineLatest, it will only emit value when both 's' and 'c' has emitted value (Module06 Combining Streams - Note41 - Marble Diagram - withLatestFrom.jpg).
And from then on, every time 'a' emit a value, it will find the latest of 's' and 'c' value.


combineLatest is more popular
Because combineLatest can use with http and action, or http and http
Where as forkJoin usually only use in http and http.


Use suxfix Subject to represent Subject:          categorySelectedSubject
Use suxfix Action$ to represent Action Stream:    categorySelectedAction$

-----------------
shareReplay(1)
1 is the optional buffer size, which is the number of items cached and replayed. which means it will always send the last assigned value.
Will it ever be another value rather than 1??

In product-list.component.ts
  products$ = combineLatest([
    1. this.productService.productWithAdd$,  -->     1.1 this.productWithCategory$, -->     1.1.1. this.products$,
                                                                                            1.1.2. this.productCategoryService.productCategories$  ***
                                                     1.2 this.productInsertAction$
    2. this.categorySelectedAction$
  ])
  categories$ = this.productCategoryService.productCategories$  ***

Therefore we can add shareReplay(1) into productCategories$

After you add shareReplay(1) for productWithCategory$ and selectedProduct$ for product.service.ts
Load Product List page, then go to Home page and go back to Product List page. You can see how fast the Product list page load
as it doesn't required to reload category and products.

Cache Invalidation:
Evaluate:
  - Fluidity of data  >> How often does data change
  - User's behavior   >> Does user log out when they finish the task? Or they will have it login all day long?
Consider:
  - Invalidating the cache on a time interval
  - Allowing the user to control when data is refreshed     >> Meaning when the data is invalidating and refresh after a time interval, if user is doing something at the time, ask user's permission first.
  - Always getting fresh data on update operations.
